# Flashcard-Generator

User will type in node CLI.js in their console and will be prompted to select which type of cards they would like to make -  Basic or Cloze cards.
Depending on which card they choose the user will create questions and answers for the cards.  Once completed, the cards will print to the console screen as well as be appended to the corresponding .txt file.

At this time only the basic card option is functional.  The cloze card file is pseudo-coded and I hope to finish it in the next few weeks.
